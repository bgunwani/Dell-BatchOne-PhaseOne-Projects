Programming with C#.NET:

	- C#.NET is one of the Microsoft programming languages.
	- This is Object-Orinted Programming Language.
	- This helps in creating different applications:
		1. Console Application (Console - Supported)
		2. Windows Application
		3. Web Application
		4. Mobile Application
		5. IoT Application and so on.
	
	
.NET Framework:

	- .NET Framework is a multi-lingual framework.
	- This supports multiple programming languages
		such as C#.NET, VB.NET, F#.NET and J#.NET
	- .NET Framework is not completely open-source.
	- Applications developed by .NET Framework can run on Windows.
		
.NET Core:

	- .NET Core is a multi-lingual platform.
	- This supports multiple programming languages
		such as C#.NET, VB.NET, F#.NET and J#.NET
	- .NET Core is completely open-source.
	- Applications developed by .NET Core can run on Windows, Linux or Mac.

	Input -> Process -> Output
	
	C Programming: 
		scanf and printf - Header File (stdio.h)
		
	C++ Programming:
		cin and cout - Header File (iostream.h)

	Namespace -> Class - Properties and Methods
	
	Namespace: System
	Class: Console
	Output Methods: Write() and WriteLine()
	Input Methods: Read() and ReadLine()
	
	System.Console.WriteLine();
	
	Here, 
	Namespace - A collection of classes, interfaces, events and so on.
	Class - A collection of Data Members (Properties) and Member Function(Method)

	byte, short(16), int(32), long(64)

Misc Types
	Annonymous Type
	Var Type
	Object Type
	Dynamic Type
	Var vs. Object vs. Dynamic
	Tuple

Errors:

	1. Compile-Time Errors
	
		a. Syntactical Mistakes or If any keyword is misspelled.
		b. Sementic Error or Invalid Expressions. i.e.,
			c = a + b; (Correct)
			a + b = c; (Incorrect)
	
	2. Logical Errors
	
		Occurs when we don't get the exepected output. this doesn't terminate or intruppt the application at all. Example,
		
		100%2==0 ? "Even": "Odd" : (There is no logical error.)
		100/2==0 ? "Even": "Odd" : (There is logical error.)
	
	3. Run-Time Errors (Exceptions)
	
		Errors occurs at the execution. These errors abnormally terminates the program. They are known as exceptions.
		
		Exceptions generally occur when an user enters unexpected inputs or it depends on external resources such as File System, Dataabase or Network.

Exception Handling:

	Exception Handling consist of following blocks and statements:
	
	try: It allows the program to throw an error whenver it encounters one. This block consists the code where chances of getting exceptions are high.
	
	catch: When try block encounters an exception, it provides the control to the catch block to handle. A try block can be followed by multiple catch blocks also.
	
	finally: This blocks gets executed every time whether an exception occurs or not. Generally, we write a cleanup or deallocation code in finally.
	
	throw: Helps in throwing an explicit exception.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Indexers:

	- Allows instances of a class to be indexed in a same way as array.
	- Unlike properties, this keyword is used to define an indexer.
	- Indexers can be overloaded.
	- Unlike Arrays, you cannot pass an indexer as ref or out parameters.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------

File Handling:

	- To save the information permanently on the disk or reading information from the saved file through C# is knowns as File Handling. File Handling uses a streams to save or retrieve information.
	
	Namespace: System.IO
	
	FileStream Class:
		File Modes: (Append, Create, CreateNew, Open, OpenOrCreate, Truncate)
		FileAccess: Read, Write, ReadWrite
		
----------------------------------------------------------------


Arrays:

	A collection of homogenous or same types of elements.
	Elements are accessible by a index number which starts from _ and goes to n-1, where n is the size of the array.
	
Types of Arrays:

	1. One-Dimensional Arrays
	2. Two-Dimensional Arrays
	3. Jagged-Arrays
	
------------------------------------------------------

Stack: Last In First Out (LIFO) OR First In Last Out (FILO)

	- Implement UNDO Feature
	- Build Compilers (Syntax Checking)
	- Evaluating Expression
	- Build Navigation (Forward/Backward)
	
Operations:

	- Push(item) : Insert the Item from top.
	- Pop		 : Remove the Item from top.
	- Peek()	 : Tell you which Item is ready to Pop.
	- isEmpty()	 : To check whether stack is empty or not.
	
--------------------------------------------------------

Queue:	FIFO (First In First Out)

	- Printer
	- Operating System
	- Web Server
	- Live Support System
	
Operations:

	- Enqueue	: To insert the element into the queue. (Rear)
	- Dequeue	: To remove element from the queue. (Front)
	- Peek		: To check which element is ready to dequeue.
	- isEmpty	: To check whether stack is empty or not.
	- isFull	: To check whether stack is full or not.

--------------------------------------------------------

Data Structures: 

	- To check performance of different algorithms to solve a problem and find out the most productive way.
	
	- Trade Off: Space Complexity, Time Complexity
	
--------------------------------------------------------

Big O Notation:	
	
	We use Big O Notation to describe the performance of an algorithms.

	Types of Notations:
	
		Constant: O(1)
		Logarithmic O(log n)
		Linear O(n)
		Quadratic (n^2)
		Exponential (2^n)
		
-----------------------------------------------------------


Out Variable:

	- Before C# 7, out was the parameter.
	- C# 7 onwards, with improved definitions, out is the variable.
	
Pattern Matching:

	- To test a value whether the value has specific type or not.
	- To implement pattern matching, we use 'is' expression.
	
Tuple:

	- If you want to return more than one value from a method, we use Tuple.

Expression Bodied Members:

	- An expression body method consists a single expression.
	- This method returns a value whose type matches the method return type, that performs some operation along with that.
	
Partial Classes:
